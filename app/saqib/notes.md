arrow function always have brackets before arrow and either {} or epxression after arrow
`(argument) => {}`

setter function in react call back...example
onChange={ (e) => setNewTask(e.target.value)}

in react we write javaScript code in {}.


steps for mark as completed....
1. onclick to list items.
2. change true to false and  flase to true "todo.completed"
3.  setTodos([...todos, newTodo]); call this
4. only use currly barckets when creating an object when theres is multiple keys / more than one item.
5. when passing array do not use extra {}, just pass name of the array.
