arrow function always have brackets before arrow and either {} or epxression after arrow
`(argument) => {}`

setter function in react call back...example
onChange={ (e) => setNewTask(e.target.value)}

in react we write javaScript code in {}.


steps for mark as completed....
1. onclick to list items.
2. change true to false and  flase to true "todo.completed"
3. setTodos([...todos, newTodo]); call this
4. only use currly barckets when creating an object when theres is multiple keys / more than one item.
5. when passing array do not use extra {}, just pass name of the array.
6. GET - we used route.js and used useEffect() inside useeffect we used fetch("/saib/api").. remeber to remove local host from fetch. 
7. when we use fetch we get the first promise we get is HTTP response on HTTP response we get json() response. then that return 2nd promise which is javascript response. 
8. always wirte dynamic route in [] and their router such as delete, PUT request in here.
9. implement on front end DEL route.
10. re-cehck my code and remeber where to pass function and wher to call that function, try learning more about front end, back local and with database.
11. always use debuging like console.log and check errors, google errors
12. saqib dont rush. and  try not to guess


sql:
1. psql -d todos -f app/sql/schema.sql (-d is for databse and -f is for the file name)
2. \dt - (display table)
3. select * from todos - query languaage
